jquery.ytLoad
=============

A youtube inspired, simple, lightweight jQuery plugin to visualize ajax progress.

[Try it out now!](http://ytload.mythli.net)

## This Plugin is not maintained anymore. For an alternative see: http://ricostacruz.com/nprogress/

## Installation

Include the default stylesheet:
```html
<link href="ytLoad.jquery.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
```

Include [jquery.transit](http://ricostacruz.com/jquery.transit/) (for smooth CSS3 transitions) and the script *after* jQuery (unless you are packaging scripts somehow else):
```html
<script src="/path/to/jquery.transit.js"></script>
<script src="/path/to/jquery.ytLoad.js"></script>
```

**Do not include the script directly from GitHub (http://raw.github.com/...).** The file is being served as text/plain and as such being blocked
in Internet Explorer on Windows 7 for instance (because of the wrong MIME type). Bottom line: GitHub is not a CDN.

## Features

- Developer friendly - Use progress to set the current progress of the loading bar or disable ajax visualization at all and just use it as a progress bar.
- Developer friendly - Progress of multiple simultaneous ajax requests is visualized
- Developer friendly - Extensible through callbacks to make anything possible
- Designer friendly - Use *your* CSS for Layout and Styling
- Translator/i18n friendly - No hardcoded English strings

## Usage

1.  **Initialize ytLoad.**  ytLoad has to be called once before it can be used ``$.ytLoad()``.

2.  **Trigger ytLoad.** ytLoad is automatically triggered on ajax calls ``$.load('ajax.html')`` or can be triggered manually ``$.ytLoad('show')``.

For examples see the [demo](https://github.com/Mythli/jquery.ytload/blob/master/index.html) source code.

## Reference

### Parameters

**registerAjaxHandlers** *= true*  
Boolean. If true progress of ajax requests is automatically visualized in the loading bar. 

**startPercentage** *= 30*  
Number. Sets how much progress is displayed as accomplished for starting ajax calls.  

**startDuration** *= 200*  
Number. Sets how much time it should take to show the first progress push.  

**completeDuration** *= 50*  
Number. Sets how much time it should take to show the remaining 70 percent after the ajax call is completed.  

**fadeDelay** *= 200*  
Number. Sets how long the loading bar should be shown after it reached 100 percent.  

**fadeDuration** *= 200*  
Number. Sets how much time it should take to fade the loading bar.

**durationSeed** *= 5*
Number. Sets how much time the progress animation takes by default. The seed is used to calculate the duration (durationSeed * progress).

### Functions

**progress** ``$.ytLoad('progress', progress, duration, finished);``   
If no parameters are specified the actual progress is returned. If parameters are specified progress sets the actual progress of the loading bar. The **progress** parameter determines how much progress is set (0-100). **The duration** parameter sets how much time the progress animation should take. If no duration is specified the duration is calculated. The **finished** parameter is a callback that is executed after the animation.

**start** ``$.ytLoad('start');``  
Shows the loading bar and starts the first progress push.  

**complete** ``$.ytLoad('complete');``   
Starts the remaining progress push and hides the loading bar.

**error** ``$.ytLoad('error');``  
Applies error style to the loading bar.

**destroy** ``$.ytLoad('destroy');``   
Destroys everything associated with the plugin (state, registered event listeners).  

### Callbacks

**onStart**  *function(overlay)*  
Called when the loading bar is shown.  

**onComplete**  *function(overlay)*  
Called when the loading bar finished progress visualization.  

**onError**  *function(overlay)*  
Called when the loading bar enters error state(failed ajax calls, manual call).

Many thanks to [ynh](http://blog.ynh.io/2013/05/24/rebuild-youtubes-progress-bar.html) for extracting the css part from youtube.

I wrote this plugin because I couldn't find an existing youtube likle loading bar plugin. In the retrospect I found out that there was one. However, this plugin was designed with completely different design decisions.
Therefore it fundamentally differs in certain aspects. A small comparison: On the one side there is [nprogress](http://ricostacruz.com/nprogress/) which focuses more on the parts of being a progress bar. On the other side there is [ytLoad](http://ytload.mythli.net) which focuses more on visualizing ajax progress. Therefore it has build in support for ajax event handlers and can visualize multiple simultaneuous ajax requests by default. Beyond that the flexibility for progress bar like behaviour is also supported.
